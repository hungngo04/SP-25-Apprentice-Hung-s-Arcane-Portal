## Theme and future plans
- This is a simple canvas with a house and a tree next to it. It contains a series of 2D vertex objects that define the geometry (triangles and circle) for the house body, roof, tree trunk, and tree foliage.
- My future plan is to modify the shader, especially the fragment shader. I will create an uniform buffer in the shader. Then I will
pass different color values for each shape. If time allows, I will try to implement lighting

## Feature Points
Earn feature points based on the completion of specific tasks. Each feature is worth **1 point**. The total possible points for this quest are **6+**. You only need 60 points from 10 quests. Do as many as you can. On average, you should get 6 points per quest.
